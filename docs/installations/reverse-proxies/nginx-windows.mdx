# NGINX Reverse proxy guide for Windows

:::caution
This guide is targetted for Windows users. [A Linux based guide can be found here](/docs/installations/reverse-proxies/nginx)
:::

## Terminology

- **API**: The API of SnailyCAD - the backend.
- **Client**: The client (UI) of SnailyCAD - the frontend.
- **NGINX**: NGINX is a web server that can also be used as a reverse proxy, load balancer, mail proxy and HTTP cache.

## 1. Installation

### 1.1. Installing NGINX

First, we need to install NGINX. [Download the latest release here](https://nginx.org/en/download.html)

![NGINX Windows Download](/nginx-windows/download-nginx.png)

### 1.2. Extract NGINX download

Once you have downloaded the NGINX archive, you must extract it to `C:\nginx`.

![NGINX Extract](/nginx-windows/extract-nginx.png)

## 2. Starting NGINX

To start NGINX you must open a command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
cd C:\nginx
start nginx.exe
```

If you have done everything correctly, you should be able to access the NGINX welcome page at <http://localhost>.

:::tip
Keep this command prompt open. You will need to run some more commands in this command prompt.
:::

## 3. Configuring NGINX

### 3.1. Setting `server_names_hash_bucket_size`

To allow for longer domain names, we must set this value to `64`. Open the `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` file and add the following code to the `http` block:

```bash
http {
  # ...
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;
  # ...
}
```

:::tip
A full example of the `nginx.conf` file can be found further down this page.
:::

### 3.2. Configuring the API

First, we need to configure the API. Open the `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` file and add the following code to the `http` block:

```bash
http {
  # ...

  # SnailyCAD API Reverse Proxy
  server {
    # Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
    server_name cad-api.example.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8080; # The API port of SnailyCAD's API (Default: 8080)
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }


    # Security headers
    add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy           "no-referrer" always;
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    add_header X-DNS-Prefetch-Control on;
    add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "cross-origin";

    # keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing.
    listen 80;
  }

  #...
}
```

:::tip
A full example of the `nginx.conf` file can be found further down this page.
:::

### 3.3. Configuring the client

Once the API is configured, we must add the client block. Open the `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` file and add the following code to the `http` block:

```bash

http {
  # ...

  # SnailyCAD Client Reverse Proxy
  server {
    # Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
    server_name cad.example.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # The API port of SnailyCAD's client (Default: 3000)
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }


    # Security headers
    add_header X-XSS-Protection          "1; mode=block" always;
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options    "nosniff" always;
    add_header Referrer-Policy           "no-referrer" always;
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
    add_header X-DNS-Prefetch-Control on;
    add_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-site";

    # keep this as-is unless you know what you're doing.
    # for SSL, see step 6
    listen 80;
  }

  # ...
}
```

            root   html;
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

### 2.3 Verify NGINX configuration

To verify the NGINX configuration, run the following command:

```bash
nginx -t
```

If the configuration is valid, you should see the following output:

```bash
nginx: the configuration file C:\nginx/conf/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file C:\nginx/conf/nginx.conf test is successful
```

## 4. Restarting NGINX

To restart NGINX, run the following command:

```bash
nginx -s reload
```

:::tip
This command must be run every time you make changes to the `nginx.conf` file in the `C:\nginx` directory.
:::

## 5. SSL

For Windows, we will use [win-acme](https://github.com/win-acme/win-acme/releases) to generate our SSL certificates.

### 5.1. Installing win-acme

Download the latest release of win-acme from [here](https://github.com/win-acme/win-acme/releases/latest). Once downloaded, extract the archive (`.zip`) to `C:\win-acme` and open `wacs.exe`.

### 5.2. Generating SSL certificates

Once you have opened `wacs.exe`, you should see the following screen:

![win-acme](/nginx-windows/win-acme/win-acme.png)

1. Press **`M` (Create certificate (full options))** then `Enter` to create a new certificate. You should now see the following screen:

![win-acme](/nginx-windows/win-acme/win-acme-m-pressed.png)

2. Press **`2` (Manual Input)** then `Enter`. You should now see the following screen:

![win-acme](/nginx-windows/win-acme/win-acme-manual-input.png)

3. Enter the domains required for your SnailyCAD instance. For example, your client and API URL: `cad.example.com, cad-api.example.com`.
4. Press `Enter` to continue. You should now see the following screen:

![win-acme](/nginx-windows/win-acme/win-acme-manual-input-domains.png)

5. Press **2 (Separate certificate for each host (e.g. sub.example.com))** then `Enter`. You should now see the following screen:

![win-acme](/nginx-windows/win-acme/win-acme-manual-input-domains-2.png)

6. Press **6 ([dns] Create verification records manually)** then `Enter`.
7. Press **2 (RSA Key)** then `Enter`. You should now see the following screen:

![win-acme](/nginx-windows/win-acme/win-acme-store-certificate.png)

8. Press **2 (PEM encoded files (Apache, nginx, etc.))** then `Enter`. It will now ask you to enter the path to where you want to store the certificate. For example, `C:\ssl`. Press `Enter` to continue.
9. Press **1 (None)** then `Enter`. It may ask you for additional steps, press **5 (No additional steps)** then `Enter`. It may also ask you for an installation step, press **3 (No additional installation steps)** then `Enter`.
10. It should now ask you to accept the terms of service. Press `y` then `Enter` to accept the terms of service. It should now generate the SSL certificate. Once it has finished, you should see the following screen:

![win-acme](/nginx-windows/win-acme/win-acme-dns-header-info.png)

11. **Important:** You must now add the DNS records to your domain. For example, if you are using Cloudflare, you must add the DNS records to Cloudflare. Once you have added the DNS records, press `Enter` to continue.
12. Continue following the prompts until it successfully generates the SSL certificate.
13. You can now close `wacs.exe`.

### 5.3. Configuring NGINX for SSL

Once you have generated the SSL certificate, you must now configure NGINX to use the SSL certificate. Open the `C:\nginx\conf\nginx.conf` file and add the following code to both `server` blocks:

```bash
# ...
server {
  # ...
  listen 443 ssl http2;

  ssl_certificate C:/ssl/xxxxxxxxxxxxx-chain.pem; # The path to your SSL certificate (-chan.pem file)
  ssl_certificate_key C:/ssl/xxxxxxxxxxxxx-key.pem; # The path to your SSL certificate key (-key.pem file)
  ssl_session_timeout 5m;
  # ...
}

# ...

```

:::tip https:// redirect

You can also add a redirect from `http://` to `https://` by adding the following code to a **new** `server` block:

```bash
server {
  listen 80 default_server;
  listen [::]:80 default_server;
  server_name _;

  return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

:::

### 5.4. Verify NGINX configuration

To verify the NGINX configuration, run the following command:

```bash
nginx -t
```

If the configuration is valid, you should see the following output:

```bash
nginx: the configuration file C:\nginx/conf/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file C:\nginx/conf/nginx.conf test is successful
```

### 5.5. Restart NGINX

To restart NGINX, run the following command:

```bash
nginx -s reload
```

:::tip
This command must be run every time you make changes to the `nginx.conf` file in the `C:\nginx` directory.

:::info
A huge thank you to [`@Local9`](https://github.com/Local9) for providing the SSL guide and documentation!

## 6. Updating SnailyCAD configuration

You must now update your SnailyCAD instance configuration to use the SSL certificate. To do this, open your SnailyCAD instance `.env` file:

```bash
# This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted.
CORS_ORIGIN_URL="https://cad.example.com"

# This is the URL to your site where the CAD is hosted.
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_URL="https://cad.example.com"

# The URL to where the API is hosted.
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD_ORIGIN="https://cad-api.example.com/v1"

# The domain of your site. Without any subdomains or paths.
DOMAIN="example.com"
```

:::tip
Replace `example.com` with your domain name.
:::

:::tip
You can now access SnailyCAD via `https://cad.example.com` with the API accessible via `https://cad-api.example.com`.
